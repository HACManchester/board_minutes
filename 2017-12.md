## First meeting after board election

**STATUS: AGENDA**

## Agenda:

- A short note on what the board actually does.
- Chair/Secretary
- Standups - are they necessary any more?
- Frequency of board meetings - historically 1 per quarter, would like to increase to 1 per 2 months
- Approve tax return
- shared todo lists/issue trackers/github for board work (not expenses) - pro's/con's/necessity etc. If we choose to continue using Trello (which appears to be working well at the moment) how often should we clear the "Done" list?
- Departmental budgets and pre-pay cards  - started under last board but needs fleshing out, a formal policy writing and implementing.
