Board Minutes
=============

There are two types of meeting minutes here:
* **Full Board Meeting Minutes** - Full board meetings take place around once per month.  They run to an agenda which will be posted before the meeting.  They usually consist of approving the previous Full Meeting and Interim minutes, Departmental Updates, Updates on Actions from previous Full Meetings, and new Agenda Items.
* **Interim minutes** - Certain decisions must be made by a board vote.  We can make these decisions in ad-hoc meetings by a majority vote.  Interim meeting minutes will contain all decisions made in such a way between Full Board Meetings.
