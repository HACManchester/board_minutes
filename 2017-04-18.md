## 3. Reducing the amount of unnecessary reporting - some of the things discussed during these meetings should in fact be dealt with by individual teams. (TK)

Minimal reporting should be maintained for operationally critical functions e.g. major changes to infrastructure including e.g. walls, MCP, website

## 4. Join MACC (TK)

I believe it to be worthwhile to join these people: https://www.manchestercommunitycentral.org/become-member

I've been using their funding portal for a while but they've restricted it to members only - I've been searching back through my emails and just found the notification. I will, need details of the space in order to join us up.

## 5. Tool Maintenance
- Tool breakdown recording
  Greg suggested whiteboard and Grandpa suggested bound book for long-term recording - Greg then suggested both would help compliance and visibility, CH agrees
- Maintenance
  I read through the compressor manual and it suggests that there is significant maintenance required to keep it in good working order. This could also be true of other pieces of equipment - we may need to look at the manuals and start thinking about regular maintenance checks
- Insurance and anti-theft measures
- Equipment inventory
  Need to keep this up-to-date, do we include tools loaned to us in the list with a notation?
  We need a central record of what is loaned, what is a member's tool, and what's the hakcspace's - and a decent setup to differentiate that, keep a record, and make sure things don't accidentally lapse into general use without intent of the owner

## 6. Insurance

We need some.
